# Analog-Clock-Project-


I made this project just to practice some basic JS skills. Couldn't think of anything better at the time of creation, and I didn't want my otiose brain to shut down :). 
As can be seen in the files, I used HTML, CSS, and JS! The clock does set to current time every time the page is loaded! Thanks!!!
